                ### Key Features
                - **24kHz Audio Support**: High-quality audio generation at 24kHz sampling rate
                - **Flow matching AE**: Flow matching training for autoencoders  
                - **Immiscible assignment**: Support immiscible adding noise while training
                - **Contrastive Flow matching**: Support Contrastive training
                
                ### Architecture
                **Stage 1**: Audio to Discrete Tokens - Converts raw audio into discrete representations using FSQ (S3Tokenizer)
                
                **Stage 2**: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Latent Space - Maps discrete tokens to continuous latent space using VAE
                
                ### Training Pipeline
                1. Extract discrete tokens using trained FSQ S3Tokenizer
                2. Generate continuous latent representations using trained DAC-VAE
                3. Train Stage 1: BPE tokens → Discrete FSQ  
                4. Train Stage 2: Discrete FSQ → DAC-VAE Continuous latent space
